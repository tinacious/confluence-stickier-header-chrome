# Confluence stickier header Chrome extension

> because the Confluence sticky header isn't sticky enough

This Chrome extension tries to make the Confluence experience better by disabling the sticky header "feature." It's a bit janky but works. 🤷🏻‍♀️

When you scroll to the top, the sticky header is reset, so you need to scroll down when it becomes invisible and then up again. When it kicks in again after being invisible for the first time, it'll re-disable it. To keep it disabled, avoid scrolling to the very top of the document.
